title: Week 3
---

This week, we started tackling our first goals listed out on our PRD. We overall made pretty good progress and have a pretty good start towards our MVP. We have basic gliding that most importantly does not feel nauseous to the user. Additionally, we have implemented a launch sequence where a user flaps their penguin arms to gain speed before flying with the hang glider. We've also done some work regarding terrain generation and making penguin flippers that feel like their connected at the shoulder of the player. We'll post an APK on our GitHub soon where you can try out gliding and provide helpful feedback so keep an out for that!

Here is what each team member worked on this week:
* Arthur: Glider physics, an interactable glider frame, and basic glider visual effects
* James: Penguin flippers details and trying to fix some shaders
* Manan: Terrain generation and starting on distance based score tracking
* Taylor: Flap detection and initial launch mechanics

## New features and functionality

## Files for review
No files in review as of writing of this, everything is merged into master

## Blocking issues
None

## Shelved Issues
Shader on the underside of the glider (currently using double sided shader but shadow isn't properly rendered)

## Goals for next week
* Arthur: Looking into wind physics interactions (updrafts/downdrafts)
* James: Wrap up penguin flippers with assets and then start on MVP presentation
* Manan: More terrain generation using low poly pack
* Taylor: Landing sequence
