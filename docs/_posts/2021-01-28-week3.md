* Manan: Terrain generation and starting on distance based score tracking
* Taylor: Flap detection and initial launch mechanics

## New features and functionality
Gliding!

Initial Launch Mechanics

Terrain Generation Beginnings

Penguin Flippers Attached to Shoulder (Still WIP)

## Files for review
No files in review as of writing of this, everything is merged into master

## Blocking issues
None

## Shelved Issues
Shader on the underside of the glider (currently using double sided shader but shadow isn't properly rendered)

## Goals for next week
* Arthur: Looking into wind physics interactions (updrafts/downdrafts)
* James: Wrap up penguin flippers with assets and then start on MVP presentation
* Manan: More terrain generation using low poly pack
* Taylor: Landing sequence
