title: Week 6
---

We started working on the tasks outlined in our PRD towards our final product. Weâ€™re really excited to get a start working on these features that will make our game really enjoyable and unique! We also discussed how we would address the feedback from our testing sessions from last week as a team, and included the corresponding action items into our road map. 

Here is what each team member worked on this week:
* Arthur: Implemented voice-based obstacle spawning POC, speed and distance HUD, and wind sounds
* James: Explored in-game sound effects, and created basic framework for game menu
* Manan: Developed first version of procedurally generated terrain and tiling system 
* Taylor: Implemented obstacle spawning and checkpoints into gameplay

## New features and functionality
