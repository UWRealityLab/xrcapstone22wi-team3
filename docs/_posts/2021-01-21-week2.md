title: Week 2
---

This week, we focused on refining, finalizing, and planning out our game! We pitched our project to the class, and received feedback from our peers and staff members. Using this feedback, we fleshed out some of the key functionalities and mechanics we will be implementing with more detail. Finally, we split our project into smaller tasks, and created a weekly plan of what each team member will be working on (outlined on our Project Requirements Document). 

Here is what each team member worked on this week:
* Arthur: PRD and the Overview section of Project Pitch
* James: PRD and the High Level Work section of Project Pitch
* Manan: PRD and the User Experience section of Project Pitch
* Taylor: PRD and the Uniqueness section of Project Pitch

## New features and functionality
No features/functionality yet, but we have started exploring assets for our game (more detail in our PRD). This includes the penguin, hanglider, and terrain elements.  

## Files for review

## Goals for next week
* Arthur: Gliding Physics
* James: Basic Flipper Model / Penguin Character POV look
* Manan: Mapping and Scoring Functionalities
* Taylor: Arm Flapping for Launch
