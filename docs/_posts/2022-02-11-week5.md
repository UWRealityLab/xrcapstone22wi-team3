title: Week 5
---

We presented our MVP and got feedback from user testing! Before our presentation, we were able to add three new terrain elements, infinite obstacle and terrain generation, and a new custom flipper model. We hit all our MVP goals and we're really proud of what we've created so far! We also really enjoyed watching others experience our game and have fun playing it. We're excited to start working on our new features and start polishing our game!

Here is what each team member worked on this week:
* Arthur: Implemented infinite spawning of updraft elements so users can play forever
* James: Created custom penguin flipper model. Fixed bug in shoulder placement when user turns around
* Manan: Create two new tiles for terrains and new starting cliff runway scene. Implemented infinite terrain generation using tiling.
* Taylor: Fixed bugs in landing to work with the new teerrains, cleaned up game for MVP presentation
