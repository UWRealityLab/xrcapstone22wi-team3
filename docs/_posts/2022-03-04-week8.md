title: Week 8
---

This week we added a sequence of tutorials that present the user with an introduction to the basic controls of our game. Now, the user completes basic tasks that teach them how to launch and maneuver the glider. In addition, we also added more exciting terrain for our snow tiles. With our random generation working smoothly, we plan on adding more types of terrain and coming up with more tiles to fully utilize our terrain generation. We also have side tiles and an invisible wall boundary that prevents flying out of bounds. Lastly, we have added collectable fish that accumulates each run which we will build off in future work!

Here is what each team member worked on this week:
* Arthur: Added invisible wall boundaries and voice multiplayer
* James: Added tutorial scenes
* Manan: Implemented fully working terrain framework and created terrain tiles
* Taylor: Added collectable fish and obstacle improvements
